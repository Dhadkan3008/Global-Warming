                long-term heating of Earth's climate system observed since the pre-
                industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities,
                primarily fossil fuel burning,which increases heat-trapping greenhouse 
                gas levels in Earth's atmosphere.</center></h4>

            <div class ="cause">
             <p style ="color: rgb(18, 196, 2)", ">1. Agriculture :- Various 
                farming activities produces carbondioxide and methane gas. These lead 
                to increase in the temperature of the Earth.</p>

             <p style ="color: rgb(8, 211, 247)", "> 2. Overpopulation :- An 
             increase in population means more people breathing. This leads to an 
             increase in the level of carbondioxide,the primary gas causing Global Warming in the atmosphere. </p>

             <p style ="color: rgb(18, 196, 2)", "> 3. Deforestation :- Plants take in CO2 and release O2 
                thereby maintaining environmental balance. This has led to an environmental imbalance, thereby giving rise to 
                global warning. </p>

             <p style ="color: rgb(8, 211, 247)", "> 4. Use of Vehicle :- Vehicles burn fossil fuels which emit 
                a large amount of carbon dioxide and other toxins into the atmosphere resulting in a temperature increase.</p>   

            <p style ="color: rgb(18, 196, 2)", "> 5. Chlorofluorocarbon :- The CFCs have led to ozone layer 
                depletion making way for the ultraviolet rays, thereby increasing the temperature of the earth.</p>

            <p style ="color: rgb(8, 211, 247)", "> 6. Industrial Development :- With the advent of industrialization,
                The harmful emissions from the factories add to the increasing temperature of the earth.</p>

            <div class ="cause">
             <p style ="color: rgb(252, 7, 223)">1. Volcanoes :- The ash and smoke emitted during 
                volcanic eruptions goes out into the atmosphere and affects the climate.</p>

             <p style ="color: rgb(175, 8, 247)"> 2. Water Vapour :- Water vapour is a kind of greenhouse gas. Due to the 
                increase in the earth’s temperature, more water gets evaporated from the water bodies and stays in the 
                atmosphere adding to global warming. </p>

             <p style ="color: rgb(252, 7, 223)"> 3. Deforestation :- Plants take in CO2 and release O2 
                thereby maintaining environmental balance. This has led to an environmental imbalance, thereby giving rise to 
                global warning. </p>

             <p style ="color: rgb(175, 8, 247)"> 4. Melting Permafrost :- Permafrost is frozen soil that has environmental gases 
                trapped in it.It is present in glaciers. As the permafrost melts, it releases the gases back into the atmosphere, 
                increasing Earth’s temperature.</p>   

            <p style ="color: rgb(252, 7, 223)"> 5. Forest Blazes :- Forest blazes or forest fires emit a large amount of 
                carbon-containing smoke. </p></div>
